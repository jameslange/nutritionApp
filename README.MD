# Nutrition App

This was my first solo project that I coded in vanilla javascript in my free time to better learn the concepts we had gone over in class.

This app allows for you to query the Edamam API in order to find recipes. It contains a search function which allows for you to search different recipes based upon what you type in.

It then retrieves information from the API and uses it to populate which ingredients that are needed as well as a nutrition table that will show you the nutrients contained in the recipe divided by the servings of the recipe.

## Technologies used

- HTML, CSS
- Javascript
- Bootstrap
- Edamam API

### Challenges

I learned the hard way the importance of mobile-first design. This is a mistake I will never make again as it is simply not worth the time trying to go back and fix responsiveness after having taken a break from this code for such a long time.

It was also not possible for me to receive from the API the instructions to prepare the recipe. For that, I have included a link to the website given to me by the API
